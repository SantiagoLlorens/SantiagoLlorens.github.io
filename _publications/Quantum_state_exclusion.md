Quantum state exclusion is the task of determining which states from a given set a system was not prepared in. We provide a complete solution to optimal quantum state exclusion for arbitrary sets of pure states generated by finite groups, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect (zero-error conclusive) exclusion. When perfect exclusion is impossible, we introduce two natural extensions: minimum-error and unambiguous exclusion. For both, we derive the optimal protocols and present analytical expressions for the corresponding failure probabilities and measurements, offering a new perspective on how quantum states encode information.
