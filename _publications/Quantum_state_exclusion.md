The state of a finite-dimensional quantum system is described by a density matrix that can be decomposed into a real diagonal, a real off-diagonal and and an imaginary off-diagonal part. The latter plays a peculiar role. While it is intuitively clear that some of the imaginary coordinates cannot have the same extension as their real counterparts the precise relation is not obvious. We give a complete characterization of the constraints in terms of tight inequalities for real and imaginary Bloch-type coordinates. Our description entails a three-dimensional Bloch ball-type model for the state space. We uncover a surprising qualitative difference for the state-space boundaries in even and odd dimensions.
