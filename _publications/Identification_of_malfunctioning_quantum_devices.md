We consider the problem of correctly identifying a malfunctioning quantum device that forms part of a network of N such devices, which can be considered as the quantum analogue of classical anomaly detection. In the case where the devices in question are sources assumed to prepare identical quantum pure states, with the faulty source producing a different anomalous pure state, we show that the optimal probability of successful identification requires a global quantum measurement. We also put forth several local measurement strategies -- both adaptive and non-adaptive, that achieve the same optimal probability of success in the limit where the number of devices to be checked are large. In the case where the faulty device performs a known unitary operation we show that the use of entangled probes provides an improvement that even allows perfect identification for values of the unitary parameter that surpass a certain threshold. Finally, if the faulty device implements a known qubit channel we find that the optimal probability for detecting the position of rank-one and rank-two Pauli channels can be achieved by product state inputs and separable measurements for any size of network, whereas for rank-three and general amplitude damping channels optimal identification requires entanglement with N qubit ancillas.
