I am Santiago Llorens, a Ph.D. student at [Grup d'Informació i Fenòmens Quàntics](https://webs.uab.cat/giq/) (Autonomous University of Barcelona) under the supervision of Prof. [Ramon Muñoz Tapia](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=SGxT9bkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Dr. [Gael Sentís Herrera](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=ai_4KiEAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously I completed a double major in physics and chemistry at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a master in quantum science and technology at the Basque Country University, Bilbao, under the supervision of Prof. [Jens Siewert](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&user=ryYiAcwAAAAJ). 

## More than physics

I started playing tennis when I was five years old, and it became the sport of my life as I grew up. During my teenage years, I enjoyed competing in various tournaments, which brought some great experiences and memories. Although tennis isn't a central focus in my life now, I still enjoy playing whenever I get the chance.
